# Cryptography Framework - Project

---------------

A Project I will actively contribute to as a major part of a academic exercise.
As well as to use the newly learned knowledge in C programming from the Professional Cert. In C programming With Linux (edX)

---------------
This project, will be a "major" project. It have several goals in mind:

**Some** (Not all of them) are the following:

 - [] Simplified Cryptography - (for those who Don't like CLI, but maybe isn't too familiar with GUI either) - All should be able to choose (simply) What algorithm to use, how many iterations, etc. Without it being extremely advanced, or technical.
 - [] Security over Performance - (I sometimes hear that - one can choose performance over security, by maybe having less iterations, or something similar)This I must admit is a crazy idea. Cryptography is created for security. Don't minimize it. In some cases it probably would make sense, (maybe if, security over performance would be incredibly slow on HTTPS - for example, this is another scenario though.) <-- will explain more, later.
 - [] 
 - 
 - [] Multi-Encryption (Cascade)
 - Many different Modes Of Operation


All, the "multiple" choices (Algorithms, Modes of Op's, ...) is going to be configurable.
(both for, users who, only used windows. And for advanced users who - likes CLI, and such) - I will try to make this a kinda - "as easy to understand, and configure for everyone" -  project.


## Major "parts":

EXPERIMENTAL!

*It is worth mentioning that **This shall NOT be used in production code. Or in anything at all that is even a little-considered serious. If you plan on using any of these Parts in this upcoming Project, I would ADVICE you to ASSUME everything in this project is insecure. (Because nothing is 100% secure) and, As I am just starting out on this project - There can (and probably will) be codes that are maybe - even unsafe to use, even for testing. So I am advising you, Read the source code, documentation, and if any questions or thoughts should appear,  contact me if you want.***


- [] New "sort" of Encryption. More on this later. <-- Will write a Technical Report on this one, it would be too long to fit in a Readme file.
- Report is also part of this project, by the way.
